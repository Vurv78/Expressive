# Expressive
> Expression, but it's Typescript and C#

Expressive is the hopeful final solution to the Expression programming languages. It was originally a fork of Expression3, but has become a full rewrite. It is modeled after [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang).

## Note
This is a work in progress. Adding this to the server may be dangerous.
And yes this is codenamed Expression4.

*This could potentially give players access to serverside lua. Yes. It's that bad.*

## Differences from E2
Practically everything.
There are classes, you can finally make lowercase variables, lambdas, and whatnot.
Everything is neatly in libraries, like ``holograms.create``

This also leverages the powerful [Syper](https://github.com/Sevii77/syper) editor instead of the wire editor, which comes with autocomplete, "intellisense", code folding, custom themes and more.

## Example Code

```ts
// You can create lowercased variables now.
// 'var' creates a global variable. It does not follow javascript/ts convention as function scoping is really horrible anyway.
var ops = 55;
ops++;
ops--;

// New function definitions typescript style.
// Note that despite this example having a lack of explicit type annotations, this is a *strictly* typed language.
// The types are inferred by the compiler.
function bar(foo: int, bar: int) {
	return foo + bar;
};

// This is not a part of typescript, and custom to Expressive.
// These are expression blocks, which allow you to block your code into scopes for organization.
// You can get the return value out of the last expression in the scope through implicit returns.
{
	var global = 55;
	let str = "ðŸ¤–";

	{
		// Boolean values!
		let anotherone = true;
		{
			// Typed builtin array types. No more array()[1, number]
			// Every value inside of it must be the same type.
			let an_array = ["Hi"];
		}
		// 'str' also exists in here

		// 'anotherone' is dropped.
	}
	// 'global' exists in here
	print(global)
}
// 'global' exists cause it uses 'var', which defines a global variable
print(global);
// print(str); -- Errors, 'str' is only defined inside of the above scope.
